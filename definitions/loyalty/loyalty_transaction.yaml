          * __Completed__: This is the state for a completed transaction. Once the state moves to Completed, updates are
          no longer allowed. The customer can use the loyalty points only after they have been moved to Completed.

          * __Reserved__: When a payment is done using loyatly points they will be placed in the Reserved state untill the
          payment is complete. When the payment is cancelled the points will be moved back to Completed so they can be
          reused.

          * __Pending__: This is the state for a transaction that has no yet been confirmed. These points will eventually
          reach the Completed state if everything goes well. These points can not be used by the customer.

          * __Cancelled__: When a deal is cancelled or the customer is no longer eligible for the loyalty points they will
          be moved to the Cancelled state. These points can not be used by the customer.
